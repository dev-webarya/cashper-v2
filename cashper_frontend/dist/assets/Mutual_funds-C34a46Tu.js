This structure allows individual investors to access a diversified portfolio without directly managing investments."},{question:"What is the minimum investment amount for mutual funds?",answer:"The minimum investment amount varies across different mutual fund schemes. For SIP (Systematic Investment Plan), you can start with as little as ₹500 per month.

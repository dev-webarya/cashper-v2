    {
      question: "What is personal tax planning and why is it important?",
      answer: "Personal tax planning is the process of strategically managing your finances to minimize tax liability while staying compliant with tax laws. It helps you maximize savings, reduce tax burden legally, and achieve your financial goals more efficiently. Effective tax planning ensures you don't pay more taxes than necessary."
    },
    {
      question: "How can I save tax on my salary income?",
      answer: "You can save tax through various deductions under Section 80C (₹1.5 lakh limit) including EPF, PPF, ELSS, life insurance premiums, home loan principal, and tuition fees. Additionally, claim deductions under 80D for health insurance, 80E for education loan interest, HRA, and standard deduction of ₹50,000. Choosing the right tax regime (old vs new) is also crucial."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the difference between old and new tax regime?",
      answer: "The old tax regime offers lower tax rates but allows numerous deductions and exemptions like 80C, 80D, HRA, etc. The new tax regime has lower tax slabs but doesn't allow most deductions (except standard deduction and employer NPS contribution). Choose based on your investments and expenses - if you have significant investments qualifying for deductions, old regime may benefit you more."
    },
    {
      question: "What are the best tax-saving investment options?",
      answer: "Popular tax-saving investments include ELSS (Equity Linked Savings Scheme) mutual funds with 3-year lock-in, PPF with 15-year tenure and guaranteed returns, NPS (National Pension System) with additional ₹50,000 deduction under 80CCD(1B), life insurance premiums, 5-year tax-saving FDs, and Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana for daughters. Choose based on your risk appetite, liquidity needs, and financial goals."
    },
    {
      question: "When should I start my tax planning?",
      answer: "Tax planning should ideally be done at the beginning of the financial year (April). This gives you sufficient time to make informed investment decisions, spread your investments, and avoid last-minute rush in March. However, it's never too late to start - even mid-year planning can help optimize your tax liability."
    },
    {
      question: "Can tax planning help with retirement goals?",
      answer: "Absolutely! Tax-efficient instruments like NPS, PPF, and EPF not only help save taxes but also build a substantial retirement corpus. NPS offers an additional ₹50,000 deduction under 80CCD(1B) over and above the ₹1.5 lakh limit. Long-term tax planning aligns your retirement goals with tax savings."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need professional help for tax planning?",
      answer: "While basic tax planning can be done independently, professional tax advisors help optimize complex situations involving multiple income sources, capital gains, property transactions, business income, or international taxation. They ensure you don't miss out on legitimate deductions and stay compliant with evolving tax laws."
    },
    {
      question: "How often should I review my tax plan?",
      answer: "Review your tax plan annually at the beginning of each financial year and whenever there are significant life changes like marriage, childbirth, home purchase, job change, or inheritance. Also review when tax laws change, which typically happens during the Union Budget announcement."

              <p className="text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                Personal tax planning is a strategic financial service designed specifically for individuals - salaried employees, self-employed professionals, and freelancers. It involves analyzing your personal income, investments, and expenses to legally minimize your individual tax liability.
              </p>
              <p className="text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                Unlike business tax planning, personal tax planning focuses on maximizing deductions under Section 80C, 80D, HRA claims, home loan benefits, and choosing the right tax regime (old vs new) based on your personal financial situation. It's your roadmap to keeping more of your hard-earned money.
